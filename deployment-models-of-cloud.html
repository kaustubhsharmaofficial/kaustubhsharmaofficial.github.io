                  Public Cloud 
                  
                  Community Cloud
                  
                  Private Cloud and
                  
                  Hybrid cloud 
                  
                  
                  Let's understand these models by an example
                  
                  Imagine you're traveling to work you've got four options to choose from
                  
                  Trains or Buses which represent public clouds in this case the cloud services offered by cloud service providers which are available to anyone who wants to use free or paid.
                  
                  In Trains or Buses, we have special compartments dedicated to women, specially-abled, etc which represent community clouds which is a mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular community such as banks, government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security.
                  
                  You have the option of using your own car this represents the private cloud, in which cloud infrastructure is exclusively operated by a single organization ( can be managed by the organization or a third party). 
                  
                  And finally, you have the option to hail a cab this represents the hybrid cloud, a hybrid cloud is a combination of the functionalities of both public and private clouds.
                  
                  I hope the above example helps you to understand the deployment models of the cloud.
                  
                  
                  Public Cloud
                  The public cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to the general public.
                  
                  From the technical point of view, there is the least difference between private clouds and public clouds along with the structural design. Only the security level depends based on the service providers and the type of cloud clients use.
                  
                  When it comes to popular public cloud deployment models, examples are Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2 â€” the top service provider according to ZDNet), Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, IBM Cloud, Salesforce Heroku, and others. 
                  
                  
                  Advantages of public cloud :
                  
                  Flexible
                  
                  Hassle-free infrastructure management
                  
                  High Scalable
                  
                  Low cost
                  
                  Place independence
                  
                  Disadvantages, such as:
                  
                  Less Secured
                  
                  Poor Customizable
                  
                  The lack of a bespoke service
                  
                  
                  Community Cloud
                  The community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It is a mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular community such as banks, government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security. This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted internally or by a third-party vendor.
                  
                  
                  Advantages of Community cloud :
                  
                  Cost reduction
                  
                  Improved security, privacy, and reliability
                  
                  Ease of data sharing and collaboration
                  
                  Disadvantages, such as:
                  
                  High cost compared to the public deployment model
                  
                  Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity
                  
                  
                  Private Cloud
                  The private cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. It offers greater control over security. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements, high management demands, and availability requirements. It is also called an internal or corporate model. Multiple public cloud service providers, including Amazon, IBM, Cisco, Dell, and Red Hat, also provide private solutions.
                  
                  
                  Advantages of private cloud :
                  
                  Bespoke and flexible development and high scalability, which allows companies to customize their infrastructures in accordance with their requirements
                  
                  High security, 
                  
                  More Privacy and reliability, as only authorized persons can access resources
                  
                  Disadvantages, such as:
                  
                  Cost, as it requires considerable expense on hardware, software, and staff training. 
                  
                  
                  Hybrid Cloud
                  The hybrid cloud is a mixture of public and private clouds, in which the critical activities are performed using private cloud while the non-critical activities are performed using public cloud. A hybrid cloud is ideal for scalability, flexibility, and security. A perfect example of this scenario would be that of an organization that uses the private cloud to secure their data and interacts with its customers using the public cloud.
                  
                  
                  Advantages of Hybrid Cloud Computing :
                  
                  Flexible
                  
                  Secure
                  
                  Cost-Effective
                  
                  Rich Scalable
                  
                  Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud are:
                  
                  Complex networking problem
                  
                  Organization's security Compliance
