                            Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine
                            learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. Amazon
                            Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data at scale and lowers the cost of protecting
                            your data. Macie automatically provides an inventory of Amazon S3 buckets including a list
                            of unencrypted buckets, publicly accessible buckets, and buckets shared with AWS accounts
                            outside those you have defined in AWS Organizations. Then, Macie applies machine learning
                            and pattern matching techniques to the buckets you select to identify and alert you to
                            sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII).
<p>
    
                                Macieâ€™s alerts, or findings, can be searched and filtered in the AWS Management Console and
                                sent to Amazon EventBridge, formerly called Amazon CloudWatch Events, for easy integration
                                with existing workflow or event management systems, or to be used in combination with AWS
                                services, such as AWS Step Functions to take automated remediation actions. This can help
                                you meet regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
                                (HIPAA) and General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). You can get started with Amazon Macie by
                                leveraging the 30-day free trial for bucket evaluation.
