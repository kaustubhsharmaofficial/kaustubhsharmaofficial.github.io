              There are four types of deployment models:-


              <li><a href="#public">Public Cloud</a></li>
              <li><a href="#community">Community Cloud</a></li>
              <li><a href="#private">Private Cloud and</a></li>
              <li><a href="#hybrid">Hybrid cloud</a></li>
              <br>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              Let's Understand it by Example
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine you're traveling to work you've got four options to choose from:
            </p>
            <li>Trains or Buses which represent public clouds in this case the cloud services offered by cloud service
              providers which are available to anyone who wants to use free or paid.</li>

            <li> Trains or Buses, we have special compartments dedicated to women, specially-abled, etc which represent
              community clouds which is a mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular
              community such as banks, government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally
              share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security.</li>

            <li>You have the option of using your own car this represents the private cloud, in which cloud
              infrastructure
              is exclusively operated by a single organization ( can be managed by the organization or a third party).
            </li>

            <li>And finally, you have the option to hail a cab this represents the hybrid cloud, a hybrid cloud is a
              combination of the functionalities of both public and private clouds.</li>
            <br>
            I hope the above example helps you to understand the deployment models of the cloud.
            <br>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4" id="public">
              Public Cloud
            </p>
            <li>The public cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to the general public.</li>



            <li>From the technical point of view, there is the least difference between private clouds and public clouds
              along with the structural design. Only the security level depends based on the service providers and the
              type of cloud clients use.</li>



            <li>When it comes to popular public cloud deployment models, examples are Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
              (Amazon
              EC2 â€” the top service provider according to ZDNet), Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, IBM Cloud,
              Salesforce Heroku, and others.</li>

            <b>Advantages of public cloud :</b>

            
            <li>Flexible
            
            <li>Hassle-free infrastructure management
            <li>High Scalable

            <li>Low cost

            <li>Place independence
<br>
            <b>Disadvantages, such as:</b>

            <li>Less Secured

            <li>Poor Customizable

            <li>The lack of a bespoke service

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4" id="community">
              Community Cloud
            </p>

            The community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It is a
            mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular community such as banks,
            government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally share similar issues of
            privacy, performance, and security. This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted
            internally or by a third-party vendor.

            <br>
            <b><b>Advantages of Community cloud :</b></b>

            <li>Cost reduction

            <li>Improved security, privacy, and reliability

            <li>Ease of data sharing and collaboration
<br>
            <b><b>Disadvantages, such as:</b></b>

            <li>High cost compared to the public deployment model

            <li>Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4" id="private">
              Private Cloud
            </p>

            The private cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. It offers greater
            control over security. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements,
            high management demands, and availability requirements. It is also called an internal or corporate model.
            Multiple public cloud service providers, including Amazon, IBM, Cisco, Dell, and Red Hat, also provide
            private solutions.
            <br>

            <b><b>Advantages of Private cloud :</b></b>

            <li>Bespoke and flexible development and high scalability, which allows companies to customize their
            infrastructures in accordance with their requirements

            <li>High security,

            <li>More Privacy and reliability, as only authorized persons can access resources
<br>
            <b><b>Disadvantages, such as:</b></b>

            <li>Cost, as it requires considerable expense on hardware, software, and staff training.

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mt-4" id="hybrid">
              Hybrid Cloud
            </p>

            <li>The hybrid cloud is a mixture of public and private clouds, in which the critical activities are performed
            using private cloud while the non-critical activities are performed using public cloud. A hybrid cloud is
            ideal for scalability, flexibility, and security. A perfect example of this scenario would be that of an
            organization that uses the private cloud to secure their data and interacts with its customers using the
            public cloud.
            <br>

            <b><b>Advantages of Hybrid Cloud:</b></b>

            <li>Flexible

            <li>Secure

            <li>Cost-Effective

            <li>Rich Scalable
<br>
            <b><b>Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud are:</b></b>

            <li>Complex networking problem

            <li>Organization's security Compliance
