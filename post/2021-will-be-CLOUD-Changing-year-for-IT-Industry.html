              <p>
                Demand for cloud has been boosted since the beginning of the pandemic, as businesses try to build
                resiliency.
              </p>

              <p>
                According to survey by Bengaluru-based talent consultancy firm <b>Han Digital</b>, only 85,000 Indians have one
                of the top 5 cloud certifications, while around 6 lakhs cloud practitioners are there.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Certified cloud architects</b> with over 8 years of work experience are among the cream of cloud talent and
                there are <b>just 25,000 of them in India</b>. They earn a median salary of over <b>Rs 30 lakh</b>.
              </p>

<br>
              <b>The top cloud players include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Salesforce and SAP.</b>


              <p>
                According to <b>Forrester's</b> report, pre-pandemic, about 20% of developers regularly used container and
                serverless functions to build new apps and modernise old ones. It predicts 25% of developers will use
                serverless and nearly 30% will use containers regularly by the end of 2021, creating a spike in global
                demand for both multicloud container development platforms and public-cloud container/serverless services.
              </p>

              
              <p>
                It predicts that the global public cloud infrastructure market will grow 35% to $120 billion in 2021.It said

              <q>
                Containers enable an application to run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. It
                has made the job of developers much easier as enterprises increasingly move to an environment where they
                use multiple clouds.
